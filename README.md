# SpikeFlow
* This is a tool for unsupervised feature extraction with spiking neural networks. 
* It provides insights like spike activity, feature extraction, animation of synapse evoltuion etc. 
* Neurons are instantaneous. 
* It also provides feature classification class and a few other jupyter notebooks with misc codes.
